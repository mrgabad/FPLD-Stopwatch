# FPLD-Stopwatch
The purpose of this experiment is to develop a significant project using only VHDL
and the laboratory development boards. Using these skills that we have learned with
stop watches and LCD panels, this project will be a sequential logic design using
push buttons to design a working stop-watch and lap timer on the LCD panel. The
goal of this experiment is to have a smoothly operating stopwatch that can be
synchronized with any accepted stopwatch that accurately times laps.
